Metagenomic Source Location Predictive Model

This repository contains the codes used to create and evaluate a predictive model of the source location (e.g. freshwater, marine water, human, animal, etc.) of metagenomic data based on the random forest algorithm. This method has been tested using whole-genome meta-genomes and RNAseq (meta-transcriptomes), however it has not suitable for amplicon sequencing data. 

For a step by step protocol of how to re-create this model see the document titled protocol.pdf.

For a detailed explanation of the algorithm and the reasoning behind the use of this particular method, see the document "thesis_final_version.docx." This document also contains the expected output of the graphs from all of included R scripts.
