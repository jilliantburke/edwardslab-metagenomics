Metagenomic Source Location Predictive Model

This repository contains the codes used to create and evaluate a predictive model of the source location (e.g. freshwater, marine water, human, animal, etc.) of metagenomic data based on the random forest algorithm. This method has been tested using whole-genome-sequence metagenomes and RNAseq (meta-transcriptomes), however it is not suitable for amplicon sequencing data. 

For a step by step protocol of how to re-create this model see the document titled protocol.pdf.

For a detailed explanation and validation of this method, see the document "thesis_final_version.docx."
